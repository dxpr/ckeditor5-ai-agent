Create a nested table structure to demonstrate the usefulness of nested tables for presenting hierarchical content. The main table should have columns for "Topic", "Category", and "Overview". Each row in the "Topic" column should expand into a nested table that provides "Subtopic", "Description", and "Importance Level". For some subtopics, include an additional sub-nested table to detail "Key Points", "Examples", and "References". Use clear and concise examples to show how this structure helps organize complex information logically and intuitively. Some cells must contain links, images, quotes, or lists.
